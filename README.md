## Tic Tac Toe in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. You can play against another human player.

### Features

* Two game modes: Player vs Player
* Clear and interactive text-based interface
* Track of wins and losses for each player

### Playing the Game

* The game board is represented as a numbered grid:
```
1 | 2 | 3
4 | 5 | 6
7 | 8 | 9
```
* Players take turns choosing an empty grid number to place their mark (X or O).
* The first player to get three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
* If the board fills up without a winner, it's a draw.
